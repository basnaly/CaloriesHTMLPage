            <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                In our days a lot of people are intrested in measuring how much they eat. I'll provide you
                an example of the recipe with calories calculation and table of calories in common foods,
                but first I'd like briefly introduce you the topic.
            </p>

            <h2 id="What_are_calories?">What are calories?</h2>

            <p>
                A calorie is a unit of energy. Historically, scientists have defined "calorie" to mean a unit of
                energy or heat that could come from a variety of sources, such as coal or gas. In a nutritional sense,
                all types of food — whether they are fats, proteins, carbohydrates or sugars — are important sources
                of calories, which people need to live and function.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Our brains, our muscles — every cell in our body — require energy to function in its optimal state,"
                said Jennifer McDaniel, a registered nutritionist dietitian in Clayton, Missouri, and spokesperson for
                the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "So for one, we want to nourish our body right and our brain
                right. If we don’t get enough of those nutrients [that calories provide], there are negative
                consequences, whether its losing lean muscle mass, not being able to concentrate or not having the
                energy we need on a day-to-day basis.”
            </p>

            <h2 id="Calories_and_energy_balance?">Calories and energy balance</h2>

            <p>
                Our bodies need energy to keep us alive and our organs functioning normally.
                When we eat and drink, we put energy into our bodies. Our bodies use up that energy through
                everyday movement, which includes everything from breathing to running.
            </p>

            <p>
                To maintain a stable weight, the energy we put into our bodies must be the same as the energy
                we use through normal bodily functions and physical activity. An important part of a healthy
                diet is balancing the energy you put into your bodies with the energy you use.
                For example, the more physical activity we do, the more energy we use.
                If you consume too much energy on 1 day, do not worry. Just try to take in less energy on
                the following days.
            </p>

            <h2 id="How_many_calories_should_people_eat_every_day?">How many calories should people eat every day?</h2>

            <p>
                How many calories a person needs in a day depends on the individual’s activity level and
                resting metabolic rate, which can be measured at a doctor or dietitian’s office, McDaniel
                said. “There’s conventional wisdom that men shouldn’t eat fewer than 1,500 calories and
                women 1,200 calories to ensure that they’re getting a balance of major nutrients and
                micronutrients.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides general guidelines of calorie
                requirements for various ages and activity levels. A middle-age moderately active female
                should consume 2,000 calories per day. A middle-age moderately active male should consume
                2,400 to 2,600 calories per day.
            </p>

            <h2 id="What_should_those_calories_be?">What should those calories be?</h2>

            <p>
                The official Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) published by the National Academies of
                Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommends that for an adult, 45 to 65 percent of
                calories should come from carbohydrates, 20 to 25 percent should come from fat and
                10 to 35 percent should come from protein. Children need a higher proportion of fat,
                between 25 and 40 percent of their calories. No more than 25 percent of total
                calories should come from added sugars. 
            </p>

            <p>
                McDaniel said that beyond those general guidelines the amount of macronutrients
                needed depends on the individual’s activity level. An athlete, for example, needs
                more carbohydrates. Food preferences also play a role. “I love bread so I’d never
                go on a low-carb diet because I want a sustainable approach,” she said.
            </p>

            <h2 id="What_are_high-calorie_foods?">What are high-calorie foods?</h2>

            <p>
                Foods that are considered high-calorie, or calorically dense, have a high amount
                of calories relative to their serving size, according to the Mayo Clinic. Oils,
                butter and other fats; fried foods; and sugary sweets are high-calorie foods.
                While high-calorie foods are often associated with junk food, some are high in
                nutrients, as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                Healthy foods that are high in calories include avocados (227 calories each), 
                quinoa (222 calories per cup), nuts (828 calories per cup of peanuts),
                olive oil (119 calories per tablespoon), whole grains, and, in moderation,
                dark chocolate (648 calories per bar), according to the USDA Nutrition Database.
            </p>

            <p>
                Raisins are an example of a high-calorie food that might surprise some people;
                you could eat 1 cup of grapes and get the same amount of calories as from
                one-quarter cup of raisins, according to the Mayo Clinic. Dried fruits are
                usually calorically dense; for this reason, they are popular among hikers
                burning a lot of calories. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="What_are_low-calorie_foods?">What are low-calorie foods?</h2>

            <p>
                Foods that are considered low-calorie have a low amount of calories relative
                to their serving size. Fruits and especially vegetables are usually relatively
                low in calories. For example, 2 cups of shredded romaine lettuce or spinach 
                have 16 calories, a large stalk of celery has 10 calories, 1 large ear of corn
                has 123 calories, 1 cup of broccoli has 15 calories and an orange has 70
                calories, according to the USDA Nutrition Database. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="What_are_empty_calories?">What are empty calories?</h2>

            <p>
                Empty calories contain few to no nutrients. They often come from added sugars
                and solid fats, according to the Choose My Plate campaign run by the USDA.
                Solid fats are fats that solidify at room temperature, like butter, shortening
                and fats found in some meats. They can occur naturally but are often added
                to foods. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Many typical American foods have a lot of empty calories. Choose My Plate lists
                ice cream, sodas, cheese, pizza and processed meats like hot dogs and sausages
                as examples of popular foods high in empty calories. Some of these foods,
                like cheese and pizza, also contain nutrients (cheese is high in calcium and
                contains protein; pizza sauces, toppings and crusts can have nutrients) but
                other foods, like sodas and most candies, contain only empty calories.
                Choose My Plate calls these empty-calorie foods.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Calories_and_weight_loss">Calories and weight loss</h2>

            <p>
                Though it is important to consume sufficient calories, counting and cutting
                calories can help many people shed pounds. Calories are expended through physical
                activity. For example, running a mile might burn around 112 calories, according
                to Runner’s World magazine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
                refers to the balance of calories burned and calories consumed as caloric balance.
                It functions like a scale; when you are in balance, the calories consumed are
                balanced by the calories burned. This means you will maintain your body weight.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to the CDC, if you are maintaining your weight, you are in caloric
                balance. This means that every day, you are consuming roughly the same amount
                of calories you are burning. If you are in caloric excess, you are eating more
                calories than you are burning and you will gain weight. If you are in caloric
                deficit, you are burning more calories than you are eating, and you will
                lose weight.
            </p>

            <p>
                When people want to lose weight they often attempt to have a caloric deficit.
                But even a person with a caloric deficit needs to consume sufficient calories
                to function and stay healthy. Eating enough calories helps maintain muscle
                mass during the weight-loss process, McDaniel said. It also helps make weight
                loss sustainable. “If someone slashes calories to lose weight, where do they
                go from there? Does that mean they continue eating less and less?” she asked.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Counting_calories_and_cutting_calories_for_weight_loss">Counting calories and cutting calories for
                weight loss</h2>

            <p>
                Counting and cutting calories can be a practical approach to weight loss.
                There are, however, other approaches to weight loss for those who don’t want
                to count calories, such as regimens that focus on changes in dietary behavior
                rather than calorie counts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether someone chooses to count calories or take a behavioral change
                approach, McDaniel said it is important to “find ways to not just slash
                calories but replace them with healthier options that are still emotionally
                and physically gratifying for that individual.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Someone interested in losing weight should consider how many calories he
                or she is eating, how many calories he or she needs and the differences
                between those numbers, McDaniel said. If someone is eating more calories
                than necessary, that person will need to change his or her behavior.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Calorie_counters">Calorie counters</h2>

            <p>
                There's a wide range of online calorie counters for computers and mobile
                phones. Many of these can be downloaded and used for free.
                Some restaurants put calorie information on their menus, so you can also
                check the calorie content of foods when eating out.
            </p>

            <h2 id="How_calculate_your_dinner?">How can you calculate your dinner?</h2>

            <p>
                You are going to prepare dinner and you want to know how many calories are in it acoording
                to your pecipe? It is very simple. All you need is to weight all the ingridients
                and write them in your prefered calories management application. Usually you already
                know how big is the dish you prepare.
                If you usually write the calories do not forget to write the cockies with coffee!
